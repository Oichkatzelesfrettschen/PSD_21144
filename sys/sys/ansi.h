 * Runes (wchar_t) is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural
 * ``unsigned long'' or ``long''.  Two things are happening here.  It is not
 * unsigned so that EOF (-1) can be naturally assigned to it and used.  Also,
 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use _RUNE_T_ instead of int.  By changing it here, you
 * lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still work.
 *
 * Note that _WCHAR_T_ and _RUNE_T_ must be of the same type.  When wchar_t
 * and rune_t are typedef'd, _WCHAR_T_ will be undef'd, but _RUNE_T remains
 * defined for ctype.h.
